This dataset contains a daily snapshot of active exclusion records entered by the U.S. Federal government identifying those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits. The data was formerly contained in the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS). In July 2012, EPLS was incorporated into the System for Award Management (SAM). SAM is now the electronic, web-based system that keeps its user community aware of administrative and statutory exclusions across the entire government, and individuals barred from entering the United States. Users must read the exclusion record completely to understand how it impacts the excluded party.Â
